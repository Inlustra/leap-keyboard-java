# LMKeyboard
A simple keyboard application built for the leap motion (WIP), originally created for my University Dissertation.

## Requirements
Requires a Leap Motion Device and the Java SDK.

## Notes
The code is rather messy as I was writing this conjunction with my dissertation.
Wrote using OpenGL (BadLogic, libGDX)
